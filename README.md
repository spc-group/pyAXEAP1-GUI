The src folder contains all python files as well as the icons used for menus and windows.

(Soon) There is a version under the Releases tab which contains full code, a Windows installer, and a portable Windows version.

(Future) There may be a pip-installable version of this GUI available in the future. There may also be a version with no GUI available.
